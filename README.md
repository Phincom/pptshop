# PPT Bar - Digital Kiosk SystemPPT Shop ‚Äî Static GitHub Pages Demo



An elegant touchscreen ordering system for a real-world PPT shop where experts ("PPT Chefs") create custom PowerPoint presentations while customers wait.Overview

- This is a simple static demo of a PPT templates shop meant for hosting on GitHub Pages.

üîó [Live Demo](https://your-username.github.io/pptbar/)- It has two panels: "Shop" (product listing + client-side cart) and "Submit" (a form for sellers to submit templates).

- No server-side code is included (because GitHub Pages is static). The project shows how to wire forms and provide secure recommendations.

## Features

Files

- üì± Customer Kiosk - Touch-friendly order form- `index.html` ‚Äî main static page with Shop and Submit panels.

- üë©‚Äçüç≥ Chef Dashboard - Real-time order management- `styles.css` ‚Äî basic styles.

- üì∫ Waiting Room Display - Ad rotation & order status- `app.js` ‚Äî client-side logic: products, cart, and form submission to Formspree.

- üé´ Ticket Printing - Physical order tickets

- üíæ Local Storage - No backend requiredHow to host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository (or use an existing one) and push this folder as the repository root.

## Quick Start2. In GitHub, go to Settings ‚Üí Pages and choose the `main` branch and `/` (root) or `/docs` as the source.

3. After a minute, your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

1. Fork this repository

2. Enable GitHub Pages:Secure form submissions

   - Go to repository Settings- GitHub Pages cannot receive file uploads or handle form submissions server-side.

   - Scroll to "GitHub Pages" section- Use a trusted third-party form service to accept submissions without exposing secrets. Options:

   - Select `main` branch and `/` (root) folder  - Formspree (https://formspree.io) ‚Äî simple email forwarding for form submissions. Replace the `action` in the form with your Formspree endpoint.

   - Click Save  - Netlify Forms ‚Äî if you host on Netlify instead of GitHub Pages, built-in form handling is available.

3. Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/pptbar/`  - Use a serverless function (AWS Lambda / Cloud Functions / Azure Functions) to accept uploads securely and store files in S3 or another storage.



## Hardware Setup GuideHoneypot and client-side validation

- The demo includes a hidden honeypot field (`_hp`) to reduce spam; keep it and check server-side as well.

### Recommended Hardware- Never rely solely on client-side validation ‚Äî validate on the server or through the form provider.



1. Customer KioskPayments

   - Tablet/Touch Display (iPad/Surface)- Do NOT embed secret API keys in client-side code.

   - Mount: Wall mount or standing kiosk enclosure- For payments, use a hosted flow:

   - Browser: Chrome/Edge in kiosk mode  - Stripe Checkout: create Checkout sessions on a server or serverless function. The client redirects users to Stripe Checkout; no secret key is exposed to the browser.

  - PayPal hosted buttons are another option.

2. Chef's Workstation- If you need a reference implementation, add a small server (Node/Express) or serverless function that creates Stripe Checkout sessions. Deploy that server somewhere secure and call it from the client.

   - PC/Laptop with good specs for PowerPoint

   - Secondary monitor for order dashboardDownloads and hosting assets

   - USB receipt printer (optional)- Place PPTX files in a public storage bucket (S3, Google Drive public file, or in the repo under a `downloads/` folder). If you put assets in the repo, they will be public if hosted on GitHub Pages.



3. Waiting Room DisplayNext steps / Recommendations

   - TV/Large Monitor (42"+ recommended)- Add a backend for payments and to securely handle seller submissions and file storage.

   - Small PC (Intel NUC/Raspberry Pi)- Add authentication for seller dashboard (so sellers can add/edit products securely).

   - HDMI cable- Replace the demo Formspree endpoint with your configured endpoint.



### Setting Up Kiosk ModeSecurity checklist before going live

- Do not include any API keys in these files.

#### Windows (Edge)- Use HTTPS endpoints for forms and payment webhooks.

```powershell- Validate all input server-side and scan uploads for malware.

# Create a shortcut with this command:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe" --kiosk "https://your-username.github.io/pptbar/?mode=kiosk"If you want, I can:

```- Add an example serverless function (Azure Functions / Netlify / AWS Lambda) to accept form uploads and store them in S3.

- Add an example Stripe Checkout server snippet and wiring.

#### iPad

1. Settings -> Guided Access
2. Enable Guided Access
3. Open browser to kiosk page
4. Triple-click home/power to start
